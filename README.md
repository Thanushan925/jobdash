### It's like UBER but for jobs.

The main point of this app is to make earning money based on your skills easier. This app should make working and earning money as easy as UBER makes taxi booking easier.

A client/customer can request a task to be completed (like painting, tire replacement, PC building, etc). They will also provide info on the general location, price range, and more if needed. Meanwhile, the worker/employee can choose from a wide range of tasks, and select which one they would like to complete. Once they choose one, necessary information will be shared between the two parties, and further arrangements can be discussed. Essentially the app is for people who need help and for people who can give it. If there’s something you need help with (like a water leak in the sink), you can post it here. If there’s something you are good at (like painting), you can add it to your profile, so you can help anyone who has a problem with that.*
